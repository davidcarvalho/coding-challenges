# Pick a number that the user will try to stop at. You can either pick this number for them or you can ask the user to input a target time.

# Once they press Enter to begin, the timer will start and the user will have to "guess" when that amount of time has passed and press Enter again.

# Print out the elapsed time and tell the user if they won or by how much they were over or under
